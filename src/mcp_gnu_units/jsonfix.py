"""Tolerant repair of LLM-mangled tool-call arguments (TODO §4.6.2, FIX A).

LLMs sometimes send a tool call's `arguments` as a JSON *string* instead of an
object -- often the whole blob double-encoded -- and that string may use single
quotes, trailing commas, or unquoted barewords. The MCP SDK validates the typed
`CallToolRequest` strictly, so such input is rejected before any tool runs.

This module repairs the loosely-typed `JSONRPCRequest.params["arguments"]` of an
incoming message BEFORE the session's strict validation sees it -- the one place
the offending bytes are still a plain string. `process_incoming` is wired into
the stdio read stream by the entry point (`__main__`); `repair_arguments` is the
pure core. Well-formed input is forwarded untouched.

When the arguments are a string that cannot be parsed into an object at all,
`process_incoming` answers the request directly with an actionable JSON-RPC
parse error instead of letting the SDK return a bare "Invalid request
parameters" -- so the model is told to send a JSON object and self-corrects.
