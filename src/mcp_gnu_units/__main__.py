"""Console-script / `python -m` entry point (TODO §4.2).

Importing the app from server.py also registers every tool as a side effect, so
the server is fully wired by the time `main()` runs.

The default stdio read stream is piped through `process_incoming` (TODO §4.6.2):
a tool call whose `arguments` arrive as a malformed JSON string is repaired
before the SDK's strict validation rejects it, and one that cannot be parsed at
all is answered with an actionable JSON-RPC parse error.
