"""Reshape SDK argument-validation errors into actionable text (TODO §4.6.3, FIX B).

When a tool call's arguments parse as JSON but fail the tool's schema (a missing
field, a wrong type), FastMCP raises a pydantic ValidationError whose default
string carries a multi-line preamble and a `errors.pydantic.dev` URL -- noise an
LLM cannot act on. `format_validation_error` rebuilds the message from the
structured `.errors()` list into one line that names each offending argument and
what it expected versus what it received, so the model self-corrects in one turn
instead of looping. Server wiring (the FastMCP subclass that catches the error)
lives in server.py.
